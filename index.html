	<p class = "intro">Hello, CS 1520 peers! My name is Devin and I am a junior this year. I'm very excited to this class as the first session made a very great impression on me. To introduce myself, I'm from the Washington DC area and I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA for school! Hail to Pitt! If you are able to read this, that means I know a bit of HTML, CSS, and Github! This semester, I am also taking CS 1501 and CS 1502 in addition to CS 1520. I hope I will survive this semester. I look forward to a great year! </p>
